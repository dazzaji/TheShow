Notes on the "Production Board" canvas iterated for the UMA Demo, refined for the CUSP Big Data Privacy book and the basis for the Unhangout LegalScienceSalon.  This is cribbed from a note to Beth Noveck on the topic:

Here is an example of how I like to plan dialog oriented hangout session in advance (basically, I treat it like an informal yet live television production) with emphasis on just three things: 1) a common name/link for each period pf time (the name of each "segment"). 2) prior agreemet on what will be displayed during that period, whether a slide, web site, screen share, video head or whatever (what we show)(, and  3)  a shared script or at least talking points/content bullets describing the substantive information or narrative at that point (what we say).. 

If we collaborated on something, I'd probably like to think through the purpose of the program, and work backwards from there to develop a concept and treatment for producing it and attracting the best host, guests, discussants, contributors, etc and then work out the segments and some nice build-up, follow-through and later follow-up.
