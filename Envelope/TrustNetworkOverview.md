# Overview:

The eCitizenConnect research project explores how existing mass-scale media services can be connected, sequenced and orchestrated to create a network of participatory engagement programs.Â   
  
 The eCitizenConnect approach was refined during a [2014 winter session MIT IAP Project][1] used, in part, for the San Francisco, New York and London ["LegalHackathon.Net" content syndication ][2]and collaboration system.  
  
 Modeling traditional television networks, stations, studios, programs, pilots, seasons, episodes and segments. The method also extrapolates from business, legal and technical media processes such as syndication, trans-media and co-branded arrangements.    
  
 Some of the interesting results from this transformation include:  
  
   
* Public Broadcast Media Network
- becomes
* Personal Media Trust Network

* Television Production and Post-Production Studios
- becomes
*Hacker Space and Agile Design Studios

* UndifferentiatedÂ Passive Audience
- becomes
* Individual Contributing Participants 

* Below is an overview of the key components, functions, flows, roles, relationships and architecture of Personal Media Trust Networks:

### Notes on Other Entities:

*   Observers, in the role of "member of the general public" may access media of a Program by permission of the Producer. However, given that they are not agreed with the basic rules they have no or very limited rights, responsibilities or any role or relationship whatsoever with any other party or role that is part of a network. They may rate media and participate in other quantitative surveys or feedback mechanisms that permit anonymized and aggregate contributions. The Host of a Program may choose to recognize an observer for purposes of posing a question during a live segment or otherwise as permitted under the applicable rules.

*   Beneficial owners of licensed media of a Program: For example, content used from a non-Network person that is licensed and allowed for syndication according to creative commons or other license terms. These people have very limited rights as well. For instance, perhaps they may file a dispute or complaint re the use of their media.)
